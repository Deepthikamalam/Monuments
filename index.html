The Red Fort is a historic fort in the city of Delhi (in Old Delhi) in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors.
Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. 
Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.
The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.</p>

It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore.
The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward.
Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort.
The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as puragiri (literally, citadel), and is now known as the Old Fort. 
Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was demolished and constructed multiple times</p>
